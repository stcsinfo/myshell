# myshell

## Purpose

Tool for common tasks/test
Three main sections:
- Core: Files for managing profile
- Modules: Section for tools
- Projects: Documentation about developed projects

## Requirements

This tool can be used on almost all apt linux OS (mainly designed for zsh - master branch/bash 5.2+)
It's just an edit of .zshrc/.bashrc file. Once loaded the new profile check for further requirements running "checks".
The recommended shell to use this tool is zsh (master branch).

## How to use

For zsh:
1. Backup your .zshrc file
2. Place core/zsh/.zshrc at $HOME
3. Replace the value for "shell_version" (.zshrc and .bashrc files) to match for your working shell path
4. Modify "project_path" (.zshrc and .bashrc files) and set the path to the project
5. Re/Load shell
6. Run "myshell" to get the avaiable commands to use (you can also use 'alias' command)
